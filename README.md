//this program is cpu based only
//this is a code to simulate optical distortion due a non rotating black hole which uses schwarzchild meterics and geodiscs to 
  render a 720*720 resolution black hole image, the distotred image is only of a non volumetric i.e is planar accretion disc.
  The user can input the camera angle and mass of the blackhole.The diffrential equations are solved using RK4.
  this is a research work based on the program. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/17qGLO51vcSFm9vf5WIz6xzuN7TMSciXB/view?usp=drive_link)

//I am currently working on same topic but where the the gui will be handeled by cpu and rendering by gpu(using Nvidia CUDA)... 
i also planing to make this a .nsi file to make this as my first distributable software(in near future).
